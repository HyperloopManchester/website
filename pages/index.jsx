        <p>
          Hyperloop is a proposed high-speed transportation system in which
          specialised pods are accelerated through a low-pressure tube to
          achieve high speeds. The system is intended to provide a more
          cost-effective and faster mode of travel between cities separated by
          distances less than approximately nine hundred miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hyperloop pod which is currently being designed by Hyperloop
          Manchester team is Hyperman I.

          The Hyperloop concept itself is an innovation pushing the very
          boundaries of transportation technology; therefore, it only makes
          sense that our vision and ideas are of the same magnitude. Our goal is
          to build the fastest pod we can and win the Hyperloop Pod Competition.
          To achieve this, we rely on the valuable contributions from our
          sponsors, who support us in technical, material and financial matters.
        </p>
